## Schedule Import Formats

### Recommended: CSV Format
For the most reliable schedule import, we recommend using **CSV files**:
- CSV files preserve text formatting exactly as entered
- Time values like "9:00 AM" are imported without conversion issues
- To create a CSV from Excel: File ‚Üí Save As ‚Üí CSV (Comma delimited)

### Excel Format (.xlsx)
While Excel files are supported, Excel's internal time storage can sometimes cause parsing issues. If you must use Excel format, follow these formatting tips:

#### Time Column Formatting:
- **Best Practice**: Format the Time column as **Text** instead of Time format
  - Select the Time column ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Format Cells ‚Üí Text
  - Enter times as text: "9:00 AM", "2:30 PM", etc.
- **Alternative**: Use General format and enter times with AM/PM
- **Avoid**: Excel's built-in Time format (shows as clock icon)

#### Duration Column Formatting:
- Format as **General** or **Text**
- Enter durations as plain numbers (minutes): 30, 45, 60
- Or use text formats: "30 min", "1:30", "45m"

#### Column Headers:
Use these exact column names (case-insensitive):
- **Time**: Session start time (e.g., "9:00 AM")
- **Duration**: Session length in minutes (e.g., "30")
- **Segment**: Session/segment name (required)
- **Presenter**: Speaker name (optional)
- **Notes**: Additional information (optional)

#### Example Excel Setup:
```
Time        Duration    Segment             Presenter       Notes
9:00 AM     30          Opening Remarks     John Smith      Welcome session
9:30 AM     45          Keynote             Jane Doe        Main presentation
10:15 AM    15          Break               -               Coffee break
```
